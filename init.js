Your Question:How can I remove a specific item from an array?
Your Answer:-

To remove a specific item from an array, you can use the splice() method. This method allows you to specify the index of the item you want to remove, as well as the number of items you want to remove.

For example, if you have an array of fruits and you want to remove the item at index 2 (the third item in the array):

var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pear", "kiwi"];

fruits.splice(2, 1);

// fruits is now ["apple", "banana", "pear", "kiwi"]git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/devkumar2313/All_problem_codes.git
